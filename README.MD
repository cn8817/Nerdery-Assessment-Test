I did not get to finish the project, but here is what I would do next:
1. create an onlick event for the svg plus button that would activate a counter that would disable the voting after the counter reaches 3
2. display the snack chosen along with how many votes it has when the onclick is fired 
3. finish styling the voting section

Things that are not part of the app example, but I would want to include:
1. add a remove vote button in case someone changes their mind about the vote (would only show if you have selected snacks)
2. when remove button is clicked the snack would be removed from display
3. make a submit button that fires a POST request
4. once submitted the selection section would clear and would display "Thanks for voting!" 
5. voting would be disabled until the next day
